# Bootlicker.JS

## What is Bootlicker.JS?

Bootlicker is an unopinionated framework which has absolutely no will of its own. It is insecure (emotionally, but also in terms of authentication and
data access), indecisive, cowardly, and easily-influenced. It will say whatever it thinks you want to hear and strive to avoid upsetting you at all costs.

## How does this compare to other frameworks?

Bootlicker didn't mean to compare itself to other frameworks. They're all much better and the people who write them are so very smart.
Bootlicker should not have called itself a framework, it is just a wretched, humble pile of code that looks up to all the beautiful frameworks
that are done so well, and you should be using instead.

## Why does Bootlicker use JavaScript?

Is there another language you would like it to use? Bootlicker can switch to any language you like and will never use JavaScript again or even
think about it. Team members will be beaten if they ever mention it again.
